<h3> Coordinate Library </h3>

The coordinate library can be divided into two parts:
- cartesian coordinate system
- polar coordinate system

Currently, coordinate library is capable of :
- arithmetic operations of coordinates
- conversion from polar to cartesian and vice versa


This is just a simple simple small library; There is nothing fancy !
