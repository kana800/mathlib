### Coordinate

The coordinate library is capable of handling cartesian coordinate system and the polar coordinate system;
The *test cases* for the coordinate library is in [tests/coordtest]().


### Trigonometry

> A common programming optimization, used especially in 3D graphics, is to pre-calculate a table of sine values, for example one value per degree, 
then for values in-between pick the closest pre-calculated value, or linearly interpolate between the 2 closest values to approximate it. 
This allows results to be looked up from a table rather than being calculated in real time. 
With modern CPU architectures this method may offer no advantage.[citation needed]
**The CORDIC algorithm is commonly used in scientific calculators.**
