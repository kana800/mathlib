### What is `mathlib`? 

`mathlib` project is collection of small math scripts; I wrote them to mainly solidify my understanding on certain topics.

There will be some notes from courses and youtube series that I followed to 
grasp certain topics, you can find them in my [`garden`](https://kannna.xyz/garden/) section.

### Library

You can checkout the `library` branch if you want to just use the library;

```bash
git submodule add -b lib https://github.com/kana800/mathlib.git
```
