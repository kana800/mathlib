### What is `mathlib`? 

`mathlib` project is collection of small math scripts; Some of these scripts are obtained from books or articles while some are written by me just to the learn the concept of it.
*If a script is taken off from a book or an article it will be mentioned in the script itself*. There will be some notes from courses and youtube series that I followed to 
grasp certain topics, you can find them in the [`content`](content) section.

### Library

You can checkout the `library` branch if you want to just use the library;

```bash
git submodule add -b lib https://github.com/kana800/mathlib.git
```
